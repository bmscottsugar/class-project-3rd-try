3rd attempt at class project
Class project for Code KY/Louisville Class: My goal is to compare population sizes of various countries with their related rate of autism, per capita, respectively. I theorize that the larger the population, the higher the rate of autism (per 1000) will be. If, this difference is statistically different (using p value of .05), I would suggest future studies to determine the potential cauases of the increased rate of autism in countries with larger populations.

Relevant packages that need to be installed to run the project:


* [Python 3.0 or higher](https://www.python.org)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)

Requirements met for Code Louisville:

1. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
